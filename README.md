   - <b>Nike vs Adidas pricing</b>

     - <b>Pricing Range:</b>
     
       - Nike products generally have a higher price range compared to Adidas products. While Adidas offers products as low as 9$, Nike's lowest-priced product is 30$. This trend continues across various price brackets, with Nike's prices consistently exceeding those of Adidas.

      - <b>Price Distribution:</b>
     
          - Nike's pricing distribution appears to be more concentrated towards the higher end of the spectrum. Adidas, on the other hand, has a wider distribution of prices, offering a greater variety of options across different price points.

      - <b>Product Count:</b>

        - Adidas generally has a higher product count within each price range. This suggests that Adidas offers a wider selection of products at each price point compared to Nike.

  - <b>Labeling price ranges</b>
     - <b>Nike's premium focus:</b>
       - Nike's strong performance in the "Expensive" and "Elite" categories highlights the effectiveness of its premium pricing strategy. The brand's ability to command higher prices for its products indicates that it has successfully established a strong brand image and consumer loyalty.

    - <b>Adidas's broader appeal:</b>
      - Adidas's more evenly distributed revenue across price categories suggests that its strategy of offering a wider range of products at different price points is resonating with a broader consumer base. This approach may be particularly effective in attracting budget-conscious shoppers who are still seeking quality sportswear.

<b>2.Is there a difference in the amount of discount offered between the brands?</b>

 - Adidas offers a higher average discount compared to Nike, approximately 10% for Nike and 40% for Adidas.

<b>3.Does the length of a product's description influence a product's rating and reviews?</b>
- There is no direct correlation between the length of a product description and the average rating of a product. The table shows that the average rating stays around 3.2 - 3.3 across all description lengths (0, 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, and 600).
- While the description length itself may not have a direct impact, longer descriptions could provide more details that influence a customer's decision to purchase a product, potentially leading to more reviews or higher ratings. However, the data provided doesn't confirm this.

<b>4.Are there any trends or gaps in the volume of reviews by month?</b>

- Both Adidas and Nike show interesting trends in monthly review counts. Adidas has more variation, with peaks in February, March, April, and October, while Nike has a steadier pattern with a high in October and lows in August and September.

<b>5.How much of the company's stock consists of footwear items? What is the median revenue generated by these products?<b/>

- The results indicate that there are 2,690 footwear products in the analyzed dataset. The median revenue for these footwear products is $4,228.52. This suggests that half of the footwear products have revenue above $4,228.52 and the other half have revenue below that figure.
